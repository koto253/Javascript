   <h3>Learning Data Structures</h3>
   Data structures are techniques for organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Some common data structures include:

Arrays: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The items can be accessed directly by using the index number of the item, and they are often used to store collections of items that are the same data type.

Linked lists: A linked list is a collection of items that are stored in separate blocks of memory, with each block containing a reference (a "link") to the next block. Linked lists can be used to store collections of items where the order of the items is important, and they can be used to implement stacks and queues.

Stacks: A stack is a data structure that works on the principle of last-in, first-out (LIFO). It is a linear data structure where the addition and deletion of items are done at one end, called the top of the stack.

Queues: A queue is a data structure that works on the principle of first-in, first-out (FIFO). It is a linear data structure where the addition of new items is done at one end, called the "rear," and the deletion of existing items occurs at the other end, called the "front."

Trees: A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes arranged in a hierarchy. Each node has a value and a set of child nodes, and the nodes are connected by edges. Trees are often used to represent hierarchical data structures, such as the structure of a file system.

Graphs: A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting the nodes. Graphs are often used to represent networks, such as social networks or communication networks.

Hash tables: A hash table is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs, with the keys being used to index into the table. Hash tables are used for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of data, and they are often used in applications such as databases and search engines.
